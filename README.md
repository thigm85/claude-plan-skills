# claude-plan-skills

Custom [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) skills for managing work across sessions using GitHub issues as execution plans.

## The problem

Claude Code starts fresh every session. Complex tasks that span multiple conversations lose their thread: what's been done, what decisions were made, what's still pending.

## The solution

Use a GitHub issue as a persistent plan. Eight skills manage the full lifecycle:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/gh-create-plan` | Creates a structured GitHub issue with description, design, steps, diagram, and links as separate comments |
| `/gh-read-plan` | Reads the issue, identifies completed and pending steps, and briefs the session |
| `/gh-implement-plan` | Works through steps in order, commits after each step, checks off checkboxes |
| `/gh-implement-plan-guided` | Like implement-plan, but with plain-language explanations and explicit approval between steps |
| `/gh-update-plan` | Updates the issue with session progress, new decisions, and a commits table |
| `/gh-close-plan` | Consolidates session logs, captures learnings, finalizes commit hashes, and closes |
| `/gh-slack-status` | Generates a Slack-ready summary of completed work since a date and upcoming steps from open issues |
| `/handover` | Prepares a handover prompt for continuing work in a new session |

A new conversation can pick up exactly where the last one left off by reading the issue with `/gh-read-plan`, or by pasting a `/handover` prompt from the previous session.

## Installation

Copy the skill directories into your Claude Code skills folder:

```bash
cp -r gh-create-plan gh-read-plan gh-implement-plan gh-update-plan gh-close-plan gh-slack-status handover ~/.claude/skills/
```

Or clone and symlink (recommended — picks up new skills on `git pull`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjoranv/claude-plan-skills ~/git/claude-plan-skills
for d in ~/git/claude-plan-skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  ln -sfn "$(dirname "$d")" ~/.claude/skills/
done
```

### Codex

These skills are agent-neutral and work with Codex. Copy them to the Codex skills folder:

```bash
cp -r gh-create-plan gh-read-plan gh-implement-plan gh-update-plan gh-close-plan gh-slack-status handover ~/.codex/skills/
```

## Usage

```
/gh-create-plan owner/repo        # Create a plan issue in the given repo
/gh-read-plan owner/repo#42       # Read the plan into the current session
/gh-implement-plan owner/repo#42         # Start implementing the plan
/gh-implement-plan-guided owner/repo#42  # Implement with explanations between steps
/gh-update-plan                   # Update the plan after a session
/gh-close-plan                    # Finalize and close the plan
/gh-slack-status --since friday owner/repo  # Slack summary of progress
/handover                         # Prepare a handover for a new session
```

After creating an issue, the skills accept a URL or `owner/repo#number`. If a plan issue was referenced earlier in the conversation, the argument can be omitted.
